Naaa.

Imagine that every minute on the website represents the day, 20/10/20

If the shooting started at 7pm, and ended at 11pm, that's 4 hours of shooting.

We want to display red during those hours.

Remember each real-time minute, represents a whole day.

So we want to get the seconds in that minute, that map to those shooting hours.

So, 4h/24h is 1/6

1/6 * 60 seconds is 10 seconds.

So the red will show for 10 seconds every minute.

But at what part of the minute does the red image show?

We can calculate that
